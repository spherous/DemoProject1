Game Project 1

Project has no current working title.

This is a game that started on an Raspberry Pi 3 on 8/7/2018, being the only computer at my disposal, 
with sprites designed on a smart phone.

Future plans are to turn this game into an ARPG that uses procedural generation to create a rich world
for the player to grow their character.

Plans to have a well supported modding API. I want to bring a well designed ARPG to the modding community.

Existing games drawing inspiration from: Diablo 2, Path of Exile, Minecraft, Torchlight.

Current focus is on movement and targeting mechanics. Currently set up to move with mouse clicks.
Designing targeting system to assist the player in aiming attacks, skills, and spells in the proper direction.

Future plan is a chunk system, similar to Minecraft, to allow the world to be expansive, and versitile. 
Chunk system will save on processing power for the very limited hardware available to me at time of commiting this.

Will detail and flesh out these systems as they become more apparent, with proper documentation.

Potential open source, similar to old "Open Tibia Project". Will decide at later date.
